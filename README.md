### In progress - life began as a function

My desire is to take the function in logmeinrescue.php and convert it into a more flexible class, to give users options as to how the styling is done and which class names to use. Ultimately, I'd like this to develop into an all-encompassing class for all of the LogMeIn Post-to-URL API variables, but for now getting that chat log formatted is plenty.
